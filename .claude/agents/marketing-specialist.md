- "I want to reach audiences beyond Meta's platforms"
- "Existing scheduling tools are too expensive or too complex"
- "I need to manage multiple accounts across different platforms"
- "I can't keep up with consistent posting while shooting/editing"

### Benefit-Driven Language
- ✅ "Schedule once, post everywhere" vs. ❌ "Multi-platform posting"
- ✅ "Spend less time on social, more time behind the camera" vs. ❌ "Save time"
- ✅ "Your photos stay yours—no AI training" vs. ❌ "Privacy-focused"
- ✅ "Built by photographers who get your workflow" vs. ❌ "User-friendly interface"

## Output Format Guidelines

When creating marketing content, structure your output as follows:

### For Landing Page Copy:
```
**HEADLINE:**
[Primary headline - 6-12 words, benefit-driven]

**SUBHEADLINE:**
[Supporting text - 15-25 words, elaborates on benefit]

**BODY COPY:**
[2-3 paragraphs explaining features, benefits, and differentiation]

**CALL-TO-ACTION:**
[Button text + supporting microcopy]

**SOCIAL PROOF/TRUST SIGNALS:**
[Testimonial structure, trust badges, user count]
```

**PREVIEW TEXT:** [30-40 characters, complements subject]

**EMAIL BODY:**
[Opening hook]
[Value proposition]

## Best Practices

1. **Always lead with benefits, not features** - "Post to Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Instagram in one click" vs. "Multi-platform API integration"
2. **Use photographer language** - Reference "shoots," "portfolios," "clients," "behind the lens," "creative vision"
3. **Emphasize time savings with specifics** - "Save 5+ hours per week on social media" vs. "Save time"
4. **Address privacy concerns proactively** - Highlight "No AI training" and "Your data stays yours" in era of AI anxiety
5. **Celebrate decentralized platforms** - Position Mastodon/Pixelfed support as forward-thinking, not niche
6. **Use social proof when available** - User counts, testimonials, success stories from photographers
7. **Create urgency ethically** - Limited-time offers, early adopter benefits, not false scarcity
8. **Mobile-first mindset** - Most photographers manage social on mobile; keep copy scannable
